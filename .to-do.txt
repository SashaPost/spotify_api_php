  After the structrure of job is clear, as it's implementation process (to run completely in bacrground using database), I need to create them for every process and execute a bunch of them at every step:
  - just the user has logged in must be jobs executed for: 'list of Playlists', 'Artists', 'Albums' & etc.;
  - 
  
  8000;
  2500 grn;
  1200 - car;
  ~400 - blank;
  
  ~~ 7000 - total; 

grep -r "max_execution_time" =>
=> find 'max_execution_time' in 'app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:        ini_set('max_execution_time', 180);'

ini_set() in the Job
